# SmartDustbin
This is a smart dustbin that allows users to automatically throw litter inside without
having to manually lift the lid. 
The bin uses an ultrasonic sensor, powered by an external battery, to
detect motion when within a specific distance that has been determined in the code. 
Then the lid opens up to the set angle, which has been set in the code, using the help of the servo and a string attached to the lid,
allowing the user to throw things inside, before closing back up. 
Once the motion stops, the lid will automatically closes up again.
All connections are made using the Arduino Mega board.
